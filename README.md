Built a raycasting engine in C++ using the SFML library. World is contained by a 2D array tilemap. Uses DDA (Digital differential analyzer) algorithm to calculate player's distance from walls. Used articles and videos for refrence, but the code and math was done 100% by yours truly ðŸ˜›. I've added the excecutable (*./cmake-smfl-project/cmake-build-debug/bin/main*) if you want to try running it yourself. The code and CMake file are here as well, but setting up SFML is super finiky so no promises there. Was a super fun project overall and I've linked the resources I found helpful if anyone wants to give it a go
